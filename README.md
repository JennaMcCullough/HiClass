# HiClass Code repository 

The code in this repository was written to explore the effect of hidden cladogenesis for SSE models. 
HiSSE allows for cladogenesis with no trait change and requires trait changes to anagenetically along the branches:  0A -> 0A, 0A 
However, this does not allow researchers to ask questions relating to the mode of evolution. ClaSSE allows for trait changes at cladogenetic events but to my knowledge as of April 2025, it has not been implemented with hidden states. To assess if a trait really has an impact on a group's diversification, we ned to compare rates for hidden and empirical states of both anagenetic and cladogenetic transistions.
