Rosana wants to test whether the passerine nest dataset would be a better 
tree to test hiclass on instead.


currently in the dataset it is: 
dome = 0
cup = 1
hole = 2

we changed it to: 
0 = specialist (hole only)
1 = generalist (cup, dome)



total species = 6321
what we have = 3224

the root can be hole nester (0)
