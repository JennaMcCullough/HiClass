Rosana thinks that maybe the polyploidy dataset (folder 1-3) aren't a 
great dataset to show this problem. So we have this other dataset that we 
are using for the SSE education MS. 

This is the Bouchenak-Kelladi and Linder 2017 Evolution paper about 
elevation of African flora. There's ~300 species. 

We've already shown in our analyses for that paper that this could be an 
issue with model selection for ML analyses that might be a more complex 
story than what was thought for that study. 

so i want to try this tree instead. Just in case, I want to do free rates 
and same rates. I'm not going to set the root at first. 

I am also using the most recent version of RB.
